--story samples--

One strange evening Bill walked into the jungle brew house 
Bill knew the red drink was terrible here
While sitting down, Bill overheard a bad pickup line
Suddenly, the radio began broadcasting tunes from the 80s
Bill was so revolted he yelled in seven languages
The police came rushing in to spectate Bill
Bill just took his apple crumble and left
One fine morning Alice walked into the deep ocean cafe
Alice was told they had stuffed crows in the basement
After ordering,  Alice noticed a pirate with no sword
That’s when the band began playing a symphony
This caused Alice to dance the circle dance
The barista had to intervene by dumping a bucket of water at Alice
On her way out, Alice took the salt shaker
